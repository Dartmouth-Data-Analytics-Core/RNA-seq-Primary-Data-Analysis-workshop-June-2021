# Prokaryotic Alignment

Earlier today we used STAR to align human genomes to the hg38 reference genome using a splice aware aligner. In some cases a splice aware aligner is not approprate for the dataset. One example of this are prokaryotic datasets. In these cases you will want to use an aligner like *Bowtie* or *BWA*. 

To practice with non-splice aware aligners we will use transcriptome date from *Escherichia coli* K-12 MG1655. Researchers were interested in transcriptional changes between exponential growth and stationary phase, you can read more about their study [here](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/39/6/2073/2411865). 

This dataset is from early exponential phase and has already been trimmed. 

This data has already been trimmed for you. 

Double check if this data is stranded, paired end interleaved, or single end. 

### Bowtie

Before you use any tool it is a good idea to look at the [manual](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/manual.shtml#the-bowtie-aligner) to get a feel for the options available in the tool that you're using and figure out which of the options are the most appropriate for your dataset.  

- options for bowtie

### BWA

### write your own code to align the fastq data to the reference genome

- compare your alignments with fastqc/ multiqc - which aligner performed better on this dataset?
