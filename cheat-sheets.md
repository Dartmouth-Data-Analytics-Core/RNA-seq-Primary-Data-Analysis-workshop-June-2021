# Cheat Sheets

This page provides links to handy cheat sheets for the tools we will be using throughout the workshop. We recommend having these open while you work if you are new to programming with any of these tools.

Note: Although we will not be using R in this workshop, cheat sheets for R are provided since R is an important tool used for downstream analysis of RNA-seq data, and therefore will likely be of value to you if you are performing RNA-seq analysis.
