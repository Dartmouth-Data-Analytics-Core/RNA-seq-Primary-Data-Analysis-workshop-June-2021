## Challenge exercise: Read trimming

We told you in the previous lesson that little adapter sequence contamination exists in this dataset. Use the skills you learn't in the last lesson to confirm this using `cutadapt`.

The adapter sequences for the kit used to generate these libraries (Illumina TruSeq) are provided below. Adapter sequences are only expected at the 3' end of reads in this dataset.

**TruSeq adapter sequences:**
- Read 1: AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA
- Read 2: AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT

You may need to refer to the [cutadapt documentation](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html#) to assist you.
