# RNA-seq Primary Data Analysis Workshop - June 2021

This workshop will be delivered on June 14th, 16th, and 18th 2021 by the Data Analytics Core (DAC) of the [Center for Quantitative Biology at Dartmouth](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/cqb/). 

All the teaching materials required for the workshop can be downloaded from this repository. Datasets used in the workshop will be available through the [Dartmouth Discovery cluster](https://rc.dartmouth.edu/index.php/discovery-overview/), which we will use to perform analysis during the workshop. You must obtain a discovery account **before** the workshop to participate. 

**Aboute the DAC:** The DAC aims to facilitate advanced bioinformatic, computational, and statistical analysis of complex genomics data for the Dartmouth research community. If you have questions about this workshop, or would like to discuss data analysis services available from the Data Analytics Core, please visit out [website](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/cqb/projects-and-cores/data-analytics-core/), or email us at: DataAnalyticsCore@groups.dartmouth.edu
