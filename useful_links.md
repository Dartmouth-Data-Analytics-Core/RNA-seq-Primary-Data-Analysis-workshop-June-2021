# Useful links

This page provides links to useful tools for RNA_seq analysis. The cheat sheets directory in this repository also provides many useful links for more basic bioinformatics & programming skills.

### Read processing/alignment
- [cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), for trimming reads  
- [STAR aligner](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR), for aligning reads to a reference  
- [htseq-count](https://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.11.1/count.html), for quantifying read counts at genomic features  

### Quality control
- [Picard tools](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/), including [CollectRnaSeqMetrics](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037057492-CollectRnaSeqMetrics-Picard-)
- [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), for basic FASTQ quality control
- [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/), for aggregating quality control reports
